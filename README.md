Module-14_-belly-button-challenge
In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. A D3 library was used to read in the samples from the url provided. A horizontal bar chart was created to display the top 10 OTU's found in that individual and a bubble chart that displays each sample was created and each individuals demographics information were also displayed.
